# Nocturne chapter two

Pallet Town is the waking starter town; Anemoia is its shadow counterpart. After catching Glim, continue east through the encounter-free Path of Grief into Desiderium. Explore the unattended town, its empty gym and Oak’s photograph, then visit Stillwood to catch and train companions. Fourteen custom species now appear across East Path and Stillwood. [Chapter guide and encounter table](NOCTURNE_CHAPTER_TWO.md). Existing Nocturne saves work; download and extract the new version, then open its index.html.

# Nocturne roster update

The custom regional roster now contains 150 species across 58 evolution families. Read [the complete design guide](NOCTURNE_ROSTER.md). Prototype sprites, existing engine moves and five-stat battle data are implemented; future habitats and encounters remain proposals. The canonical starter expressions sit outside the regional roster.

# Pokémon Nocturne — playable opening

The Nocturne campaign begins in Pallet Town and crosses into its unattended shadow counterpart, Anemoia. See [NOCTURNE_FOUNDATION.md](NOCTURNE_FOUNDATION.md) for controls, the opening route, testing, and current limitations.

Run `python3 -m http.server 8000` from this folder, then open `http://localhost:8000`. No install or build is required.

The original engine documentation and credits follow.

## The prompt

The whole project started from one message typed into [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code):

> using only pixels directly remake a beautiful pokemon red remake but with better graphics, environments and vfx. visualise everything perfectly as pixel art using raw pixels. absolute pixel art perfection. keep the story exactly as pokemon red (research on web for all dialogue etc)

Everything in this repository grew from that sentence, followed by a few days of playing it and asking for fixes.

## Play

Play it in your browser at **[claudered.dev](https://claudered.dev)**, on a computer or a phone.

To run it yourself, there's no install and no build step. Clone the repo and open `index.html` in a browser.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/levy-street/pokemon-claude-red.git
cd pokemon-claude-red
open index.html            # or double-click it
```

To run the full site (email sign-up, accounts with cloud saves, the hit counter), serve it with the bundled
server. It needs only Python 3:

```sh
node tools/build_dist.js      # bundles index.html + src/ into dist/
python3 tools/serve.py        # http://localhost:8784
```

### Controls

| | Keyboard | Touch | Gamepad |
|---|---|---|---|
| Move / navigate | Arrow keys or WASD | D-pad, or tap a tile to walk there | D-pad / left stick |
| A: talk, confirm | Z, J or Space | A, or tap a person, sign or menu item | A |
| B: cancel, hold to run | X, K, Backspace or Esc | B | B |
| START: menu | Enter | START | Start |
| SELECT | Shift or C | SELECT | Select |

On a computer, the mouse also works: click to walk or pick menu entries, right-click for B or the START menu, and scroll lists with the wheel.
Progress saves to the browser. An optional free account keeps a copy on the server, so the game survives in-app browsers that wipe storage and can move between devices.

## What's in it

- **The complete Kanto story**: all 224 maps, every trainer, the eight gyms, Team Rocket, Silph Co., the Elite Four, the
  Champion and Cerulean Cave, with Red's event order and gating. All ~2,500 lines of dialogue follow the original
  beat for beat, rewritten in new words.
- **Every pixel is code.**
  - The game draws into a 320×180 framebuffer (`Uint32Array`), then scales it up with crisp nearest-neighbour pixels.
  - Each map cell has a semantic label ("tall grass", "roof", "bookshelf"), and a procedural painter draws it with shading and texture.
  - Buildings are painted as whole objects with roofs, windows, doors and shadows.
  - There's a day/night cycle with lit windows, fireflies and flickering torches.
  - Every one of the 165 moves has its own animation.
- **151 Pokémon from shapes.** A small drawing language (ellipses, polygons, spots, stripes, eyes) is rasterised into
  outlined, shaded pixel art, and back sprites and party icons are derived from the same description.
- **The original music, re-voiced.** The note data of all 52 songs is converted from the disassembly. A sequencer that
  keeps the Game Boy's exact frame timing plays it through new Web Audio instruments: chorused pulse leads, a wave
  bass with a sub layer, and noise drums with body.
- **A character customiser**: hair, hats, skin, clothes and bag colours, carried through every sprite and portrait.
- **Social Zone**, entered through any Pokémon Center's Cable Club:
  - a live lounge: everyone online walks around the same room, with name tags, chat bubbles and a list of who's in;
  - real-time link battles and trades: talk to anyone to challenge them, or join the random-match queue;
  - a level-50 Battle Tower;
  - battles and trades with friends through shareable links, and a two-player versus mode on one screen.
- **Who's That Pokémon?** A daily and endless silhouette quiz.
- **Share cards**: every badge, capture, evolution and Hall of Fame entry can become a pixel-art card or a link.
- **Classic glitches, recreated from how the original code works:**
  - [MissingNo.](#missingno) with its +128 item quantity and Hall of Fame corruption;
  - the [Mew trick](#the-mew-trick).
- **Easter eggs**: the world has opinions about AI. Talk to everyone.

### Link battles

A live link battle runs in both players' browsers at once. Each game shows its own team at the bottom and sends only
its picks (a move, a switch, a replacement) through the server. Both games roll from the same random seed, so they
work out identical turns. Each turn the host also sends a checksum and a snapshot of the battle, and if the other game
ever drifts it takes the host's numbers. `node tools/pvpfuzz.js` battles two copies of the game against each other
to check they stay in step.

### MissingNo.

The old man's catching demo in Viridian City backs your name up into the memory that holds the area's wild Pokémon
list. Only maps that have grass encounters overwrite that list. The shore squares just east of Cinnabar Island take
their encounter rate from the water, but their Pokémon list from that leftover memory.

1. Watch the old man's demo.
2. Fly to Cinnabar without walking through any grass or caves.
3. Surf up and down the east coast.

The letters of your name, read as level/species bytes, decide what appears: MISSINGNO., 'M, and sometimes a
Lv 132 Mewtwo. Meeting MissingNo. adds 128 to the sixth item in your bag.

### The Mew trick

1. Press START mid-step as a far-off trainer spots you, then Fly away. That route's script is left waiting to start
   the battle, and START won't open until you finish a trainer battle.
2. The next battle overwrites the trainer bytes that script will read. Let the Route 25 Youngster's Slowpoke be that
   battle: its Special stat is 21, which is Mew's internal ID.
3. Walk back onto the route. The START menu opens by itself; close it and a wild Lv 7 Mew appears.

## How it's built

```
index.html          the page: canvas, phone controller, account box, script list
src/core/           framebuffer + drawing primitives, pixel font, input, main loop, audio synth + GB sequencer
src/art/            procedural renderers: terrain, buildings, interiors, characters, Pokémon, battle scenes, VFX
src/data/           maps, species, moves, trainers, music (converted from pokered), dialogue, Pokémon shape files
src/game/           overworld, battles, menus, PC, bag, Pokédex, Social Zone, sharing, cloud saves, glitches
src/scripts/        the story, map by map, following Red's event scripts
tools/              data converters, headless runner, fuzzers, map/sprite/VFX sheet renderers, the site server
docs/               how maps, sprites, dialogue and story scripts are authored
```

It's plain JavaScript loaded with classic `<script>` tags. There are no frameworks and no bundler, and it runs from `file://`.

### Rebuilding the data

Map layouts, collision, warps, trainers, wild encounters, species, moves and the music's note data are converted from
the [pret/pokered](https://github.com/pret/pokered) disassembly. No graphics or original text are taken from it.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pret/pokered ../pokered
node tools/convert_maps.js  ../pokered
node tools/convert_data.js  ../pokered
node tools/convert_music.js ../pokered
```

### Testing

`tools/headless.js` runs the entire game inside Node's `vm` with no browser, and can save any frame as a PNG. Test
drivers are built on top of it:

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `node tools/talkfuzz.js` | Visits all 224 maps, talks to every NPC and reads every sign (1,000+ conversations), playing out any battles. |
| `node tools/fuzzbattle.js` | Random battles with random species, levels and movesets; reports exceptions and stuck battles. |
| `node tools/pvpfuzz.js` | Two copies of the game fight random link battles through their picks alone; every turn must match in both. |
| `node -r ./tools/pathaudit.js tools/stepfuzz.js` | Fires every step/enter script on every walkable cell under random story states; flags anyone walking through a wall. |
| `node tools/warpcheck.js` | Walks the warp graph and checks every exit leads back where it came from. |
| `node tools/rendermap.js <Map> out.png` | Renders a whole map. `monsheet.js`, `vfxsheet.js` and `charsheet.js` do the same for Pokémon, move animations and characters. |

### Hosting

`node tools/build_dist.js https://your.site/` writes a static `dist/` (plus a `preview.png` for link previews) that any
web host can serve. Set `CF_BEACON_TOKEN=<site token>` to include Cloudflare Web Analytics, which is cookieless.

`tools/serve.py` adds the small site API: email sign-ups, accounts, cloud saves and the hit counter. It stores
everything in one SQLite file under `data/`. It also runs the live Social Zone (`tools/lounge.py`): presence, chat,
offers and the link battle relay, kept in memory and sent over WebSockets, with long polling as a fallback. Passwords are stored only as salted scrypt hashes, and session tokens only
as SHA-256 hashes.

The game also sends a small, anonymous gameplay log (`src/game/analytics.js`): every shareable moment (badges, catches,
evolutions, the Hall of Fame, Tower streaks, link battles, trades), first visits to towns and dungeons, blackouts,
saves, quiz scores, shares and a heartbeat. Each save and each browser gets a random id; there are no emails, and the
server keeps a visitor's country but never their IP address. Browsers that send Do Not Track or Global Privacy Control
send nothing. `python3 tools/serve.py stats [days]` prints the report: where visitors come from, how far players get
(a funnel from starter to Champion), where they stop and black out, what they catch and share, and a leaderboard.

Newsletter sign-ups are kept locally, then forwarded to the Levy Street list. If the page is hosted without the
server, it signs up with the list directly. `python3 tools/serve.py export` prints the email list as CSV, and
`python3 tools/serve.py sync-newsletter` retries any sign-up the list hasn't accepted yet.
